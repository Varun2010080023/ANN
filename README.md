## Project Overview
This project implements an ANN-based classification model using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on a dataset to perform multi-class or binary classification tasks.

## Installation
To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ann-classification.git
cd ann-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Adjust the hyperparameters in `config.py` as needed.
3. Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

4. Evaluate the model using:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

5. Make predictions on new data:

```bash
python predict.py --input sample_data.csv
```

## Dataset
- The dataset should be formatted as CSV with features and labels.
- Ensure proper preprocessing before feeding it into the model.

## Model Architecture
The ANN model consists of:
- Input layer matching the number of features
- Multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Output layer with Softmax (multi-class) or Sigmoid (binary)

## Training
- Uses categorical cross-entropy (multi-class) or binary cross-entropy (binary) loss functions.
- Adam optimizer with learning rate tuning.
- Model checkpoints and early stopping implemented.

## Evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are computed.
- Confusion matrix visualization.

## Results
- The trained model's performance will be logged in the `logs/` directory.
- Sample evaluation results and confusion matrix plots will be stored.
